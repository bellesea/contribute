        Hack Club is a <span class="highlight">nonprofit network of high school
        coding clubs and makers around the world</span>. The Hack Club community
        has <span class="highlight">over 250 open source repositories</span>, many of which are being actively
        developed every day. What makes these repositories open source is that
        they are <span class="highlight">editable by the public</span>, which
        encourages you, the Hack Club community, to come together and work on code socially.
        Contributions can be made in many ways, like tracking bugs and features by
        opening a
        <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues" target="_blank">GitHub issue</a>,
        editing code by creating a

        and

        made by others.

        We <span class="highlight">welcome and encourage your contributions</span>,
        and we look forward to seeing the things you create!

              Contributions can happen in a lot of ways. Adding <strong>issues</strong>,
